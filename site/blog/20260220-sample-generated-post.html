<h2>Why this project mattered</h2>
<p>Our support team was handling fast-growing volume with delayed first responses. We introduced an AI triage layer to classify tickets, score urgency, and draft first replies.</p>
<h2>Results snapshot</h2>
<ul>
<li>Median first response time improved from 8.5h to 3.6h</li>
<li>Escalation rate stayed stable at 22%</li>
<li>Agent confidence increased after adding prompt guardrails</li>
</ul>
<h2>What failed first</h2>
<p>The model over-prioritized emotional language, which occasionally inflated urgency. We fixed this with explicit policy examples and confidence thresholds.</p>
<h2>Build pattern you can copy</h2>
<p>1. Start with one narrow workflow (triage only).</p>
<p>2. Measure one KPI weekly.</p>
<p>3. Add human-review checkpoints before auto-actions.</p>
<h2>Final takeaway</h2>
<p>Small automation layers can create outsized operational wins when paired with clear prompts and weekly tuning.</p></article></main></body></html>
